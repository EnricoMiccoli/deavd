# Buckets
The collection of all things to organize is called a bucket. When the user runs a search, all results are pooled only from the current bucket.

A bucket is just a directory containing:

* `bucketname.json`, a file that keeps track of all the files and their tags
* all the binary files.

The user can choose from the many buckets that are all stored under `sitefiles/buckets/`.
